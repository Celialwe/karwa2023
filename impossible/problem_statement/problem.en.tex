While his teams are participating in BAPC, Henri, their coach, is getting bored.
He thus decides to try the problems of the 1\textsuperscript{st} edition of the prestigious KARWa.
One of these problems, ``Stockage Difficile'', consists of finding the number of ways you can arrange alcoholic beverages, a problem which calls to advanced concepts of numerical analysis and the finite element method.

However, Henri, who's so close to the solution, doesn't remember how to calculate the perimeter of a square from its area.
Given the area $a$ of a square, help Henri to calculate its perimeter.

\begin{Input}
	An integer $a$ ($0 \le a \le \maxa$), the area of the square.
\end{Input}

\begin{Output}
	The perimeter of a square of area $a$.
	The answer must have a relative or absolute error of at most $10^{-6}$.
\end{Output}
