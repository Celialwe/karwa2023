Jérôme and his two teammates must get to KARWa at UMons.
Unfortunately, they made a mistake and ended up at UCLouvain!
They don't have much time and so ask their friend Nicolas - an expert of maps and of shortest parts - who has a map with $n$ stations and $m$ bidirectional train lines each taking some time $w$.
Can you determine if they'll arrive in time?

UCLouvain is represented by the $1$ intersection and UMons by the $n$ intersection.
A path is guaranteed between the two universities.

\begin{Input}
	The input consists of :
	\begin{itemize}
		\item One line with two integers $n$ and $m$ ($2 \le n, m \le 10^6$), where $n$ is the number of intersections and $m$ is the number of connections,
		\item $m$ lines with 3 integers each $u$ ($1 \le u \le n$), $v$ ($1 \le v \le n$), and $w$ ($1 \le w \le 10^6$), which represent a bidirectional connection between $u$ and $v$, with a time of $w$.
	\end{itemize}
\end{Input}

\begin{Output}
	An integer with the length of the shortest path between $1$ and $n$.
\end{Output}
