Brieuc and Aymeric are going to KARWa, but they're getting bored in the train.
To pass the time, they're playing a game of matchsticks.
The game consists of $n$ matchsticks and, each round, each player can remove 1 to $k$ matchsticks.
\textbf{The player which removes the last matchstick wins}.

Brieuc is a bit of a smartass, and he prefers starting.
Can you determine who will win the game if the two players play in the optimal manner?

\begin{Input}
	Two integers $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^9$) and $k$ ($1 \le k < n$), where $n$ and $k$ respectively represent the total number of matchsticks and the number of matchsticks each player can remove each round.
\end{Input}

\begin{Output}
	The name of the winner of the same if both players play in an optimal manner: ``\verb|Brieuc|'' if the first player wins, ``\verb|Aymeric|'' otherwise.
\end{Output}
