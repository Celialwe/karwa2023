To chill down after the contest, the KARWa organizing team has prepared a large number of alcoholic beverages stored in a big fridge $n$ spots wide, and two spots high.
You can store each beverage in two ways: either vertically, such that it takes one spot in width and two spots in height, either horizontally, such that it takes two spots in width and one spot in height.
How many different ways is it possible to fill the fridge?

Watch out, the answer can be very large.
We're thus asking you to output the answer modulo $7+10^9$.

\begin{Input}
	An integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^{6}$), the number of spots the fridge is wide.
\end{Input}

\begin{Output}
	The number of ways to store the beverages in the fridge modulo $7+10^9$.
\end{Output}
