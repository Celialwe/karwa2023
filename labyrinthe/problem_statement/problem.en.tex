Sunday morning at 2:30, Virgil's and Aymeric's teams are coming back from a karaoke in the city of Eindhoven.
Unfortunately, at this time, certain roads are blocked and they don't know if they'll be able to reach the bus stop.
The grid which represents the city is of size $n \times m$, with $n$ and $m$ between 2 and 1000.
Each cell of the grid can contain a ``\verb|#|'' for a wall, ``\verb|K|'' for both teams, ``\verb|B|'' for a bus stop, and ``\verb|.|'' for a free spot.

Can you determine if there exists a path to arrive at the bus stop from the starting point of the teams?

\begin{Input}
	The input consists of;
	\begin{itemize}
		\item One line with two integers $n$ and $m$ ($2 \le n, m \le 2000$), the size of the grid $n \times m$,
		\item $n$ lines of $m$ characters, representing the grid.
	\end{itemize}
\end{Input}

\begin{Output}
	``\verb|yes|'' if there exists a path allowing them to reach the bus stop,
	``\verb|no|'' otherwise.
\end{Output}
