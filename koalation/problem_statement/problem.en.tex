The Australian Koalation, represented by the Wallabies, also known by the name of KARWa, is an Australian company composed of koalas and wallabies.
The wallabies being much smarter than the koalas, who have a limited capacity in division, have invented a referencing system.
Here is how it works:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Each wallaby is represented by a prime number.
	\item Each koala is represented by an integer. It is assigned to the wallaby having for its number the smallest divisor of its own number, except for 1. For example, koala 15 is assigned to wallaby 3.
\end{itemize}

However, with the increasing number of new arrivals, the koalas have become much more difficult to group by their referent.
The KARWa thus needs your help to create an algorithm which, from a list of number representing the koalas, returns a new sorted list based on the referents of each koala in increasing order.
If two koalas have the same referent, it's the increasing order which is used.

\begin{Input}
	The input consists of;
	\begin{itemize}
		\item un entier $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 10^4$), le nombre d'éléments dans la liste,
		\item One line with an integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 10^4$), the number of elements in the list.
		\item One line with $n$ integers $n_i$, for $i$ going from $0$ to $n$ ($2 \leq n_i \leq 10^5$).
	\end{itemize}
\end{Input}

\begin{Output}
	One line containing the $n_1$ values ordered based on their smallest divisor and in increasing order.
\end{Output}
